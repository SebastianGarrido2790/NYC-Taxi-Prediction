## Feature Importance Analysis

**Interpretation**

- **Dominance of Daily Patterns:**
    - rolling_mean_24h (0.4067) and lag_24_ride_count (0.3350) together dominate the feature importance, indicating that the model relies heavily on the 24-hour periodicity of taxi demand. This makes sense for a time-series problem like taxi demand, where daily cycles (e.g., morning rush, evening rush) are strong predictors.

    - The high importance of these features suggests that the model is effectively capturing daily trends, which is a strength for predicting regular patterns.

- **Reduced Focus on Short-Term Lags:**
    - lag_1_ride_count (0.0475) is still important but much less than expected. This might indicate that the model is less sensitive to immediate changes in demand and more focused on longer-term trends.

    - Other lags (lag_2, lag_3, lag_6, lag_12) have relatively low importance (0.010–0.015), suggesting that intermediate lags are less informative compared to the 1-hour and 24-hour lags.

- **Temporal Features:**
    - hour_of_day (0.0187), is_rush_hour (0.0191), and day_of_week (0.0171) have moderate importance, indicating that the model captures hourly and weekly patterns but relies on them less than daily trends.

    - is_holiday (0.0125) has low importance, which aligns with the error analysis showing higher errors on holidays—the model isn’t effectively using this feature.

- **Spatial Features:**
    - is_downtown (0.0208) is the fifth most important feature, suggesting that the model does consider location (downtown vs. non-downtown) as a significant factor. This is a positive sign, as downtown areas likely have different demand patterns compared to other zones.

- **Weather Features:**
    - Weather features (temperature, humidity, wind_speed, amount_of_precipitation, cloud_cover_numeric) have very low importance (0.005–0.011), consistent with the previous analysis. This suggests that weather has a minimal impact on the model’s predictions, which might be a limitation if weather significantly affects taxi demand in reality.

- **Zero Importance for is_weekend:**
    - The importance of is_weekend being 0.0 is surprising, especially since the error analysis shows higher errors on weekends (24.0030 vs. 21.1799 on weekdays). This indicates that the model is not effectively using this feature to adjust predictions for weekends, which is a clear area for improvement.

### Feature Importance Plot
The plot (xgboost_feature_importance.png) visually confirms the dominance of rolling_mean_24h and lag_24_ride_count, with a steep drop-off in importance for other features. The long tail of low-importance features (e.g., weather features, is_weekend) highlights that the model is heavily skewed toward a few key features.

### Strengths:
- The model effectively captures daily patterns (rolling_mean_24h, lag_24_ride_count), which are critical for taxi demand forecasting.

- Temporal features (hour_of_day, is_rush_hour, day_of_week) and spatial features (is_downtown) have moderate importance, indicating that the model considers these factors, albeit to a lesser extent.

### Weaknesses:
- The zero importance of is_weekend is a significant issue, given the higher errors on weekends. The model is not adjusting predictions for weekend patterns, which likely contributes to the increased errors on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

- The low importance of is_holiday (0.0125) suggests that the model might struggle with holidays, although we can’t confirm this with the test set (no holidays in March 2019).

- Weather features have very low importance, which might be a limitation if weather significantly affects taxi demand (e.g., heavy rain might increase demand for taxis).

## Error Analysis

**Overall MAE**

- Overall MAE: 22.0880 (consistent with the training results, confirming that the predictions are correctly aligned).

- Interpretation:
Top ten zones correspond to busy Manhattan areas (e.g., Zone 186 is Times Square/Theatre District, Zone 230 is Upper East Side North, Zone 48 is Clinton East, Zone 79 is East Village). The high errors in these zones align with the previous analysis, where busy, high-variability areas were prone to larger prediction errors.

The errors are significantly higher than the overall MAE (22.0880), with Times Square having an average error of 65.9009—almost 3 times the overall MAE. This indicates that the model struggles to predict demand in these high-demand, high-variability zones.

### High-Error Scenarios:
- Zones: High errors in busy Manhattan zones (e.g., Times Square, Upper East Side) indicate that the model struggles with high-variability areas. These zones likely experience sudden demand spikes due to events, tourism, or commuting patterns that the model doesn’t capture.

- Rush Hours: Higher errors during rush hours (25.3525 vs. 21.2829) and peaks at 7–8 AM and 5–7 PM suggest that the model underestimates or overestimates demand during these periods.

- Weekends: Higher errors on weekends (24.0030 vs. 21.1799), especially on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, indicate that the model fails to capture weekend-specific patterns (e.g., social activities, tourism).

### Low-Error Scenarios:
- The model performs well overnight (3–4 AM) when demand is low and stable.

- Errors are lower on weekdays like Tuesday and Wednesday, likely due to more predictable commuting patterns.

## Next Steps
The analysis has provided deeper insights into the model’s strengths and weaknesses. Here are the most immediate next steps:

**1. Feature Engineering:**
- Add interaction features for weekends (is_weekend * hour_of_day), rush hours (is_rush_hour * lag_1_ride_count), and high-variability zones (is_downtown * hour_of_day).

- Add categorical weather features (e.g., is_raining) and interaction terms (e.g., amount_of_precipitation * is_rush_hour).

**2. Retrain the Model:**
- Retrain the XGBoost model with the new features and evaluate whether the Test MAE improves, particularly on weekends, during rush hours, and in high-variability zones.

**3. Zone-Specific Analysis:**
- Dive deeper into the errors in high-variability zones like Times Square (Zone 186). Analyze whether the model systematically overestimates or underestimates demand in these zones and during specific hours (e.g., rush hours).

**4. Ensemble Modeling:**
- Experiment with an ensemble of XGBoost and LightGBM to see if combining their predictions reduces errors in high-error scenarios.

Let’s create a script (analyze_busy_zones.py) to analyze specific busy zones with high errors, focusing on zones like Times Square (Zone 186), Upper East Side North (Zone 230), and others identified in the error analysis. The script will:

1. Load the error analysis data generated by analyze_model.py.

2. Filter for the top high-error zones (e.g., top 10 zones with the highest average absolute error).

3. Perform a detailed analysis for these zones, including:

- Error distribution (e.g., histogram of absolute errors).

- Error by hour of day, day of week, rush hour status, and weekend status.

- Systematic bias (e.g., does the model consistently overestimate or underestimate demand?).

- Comparison of actual vs. predicted demand over time.

4. Generate visualizations and save the results to a dedicated directory.

This script will help us understand why the model struggles in these high-variability zones and provide insights for improvement.
